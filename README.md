# SSH Helper

A tool to help you manage your ssh hosts, making it easy to both quickly list your current hosts, as well as quickly generate new hosts.


## Installation

You can use `go get` to install the tool:

```bash
$ go get github.com/aalbacetef/ssh-helper/...
```


Additionally, you can use the pre-built binary (linux):

- [ssh-helper v0.1.2](https://github.com/aalbacetef/ssh-helper/releases/download/v0.1.2/ssh-helper) (Linux 64-bit)

To download:

```bash
$ wget https://github.com/aalbacetef/ssh-helper/releases/download/v0.1.1/ssh-helper && chmod +x ssh-helper
```

## Examples

#### Add a new host
To add a host with an existing key pair:

```
$ ssh-helper add \
  --name my-test-host \
  --hostname my.test.host \
  --user testuser \
  --identityfile /path/to/private/key
```


To add a host with the key pair being generated:
```
$ ssh-helper add \
  --name my-test-host \
  --hostname my.test.host \
  --user testuser \
  --newkey 
```

#### Remove an existing host

Suppose you already have a host with name `existing-host`, then you could:

```bash
$ ssh-helper remove --host existing-host
```
