# SSH Helper

A tool to help you manage your ssh hosts, making it easily to both quickly list your current hosts, as well as quickly generate new hosts.

## Examples

#### Add a new host
To add a host with an existing key pair:

```
ssh-helper add \
  --name my-test-host \
  --hostname my.test.host \
  --user testuser \
  --identityfile /path/to/private/key
```


To add a host with the key pair being generated:
```
ssh-helper add \
  --name my-test-host \
  --hostname my.test.host \
  --user testuser \
  --newkey 
```
